                        <p>These Regulations revoke and replace, with amendments and saving provision, the Environmental
                            Impact Assessment (Forestry) (Scotland) Regulations 1999 (<ref
                                    href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ssi/1999/43">S.S.I. 1999/43</ref>). These
                            Regulations apply in relation to Scotland, and in relation to projects of afforestation,
                            deforestation, forest road works and forest quarry works (“forestry projects”).

                        </ref> on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the
                            environment (<abbr class="Acronym" title="Official Journal">OJ</abbr> L 26, 28.1.2012, p.1),

                                Directive 2014/52/EU
                            </ref> of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 124, 25.4.2014, p.1). The
                            Regulations impose procedural requirements in relation to the consideration of applications
                            to carry out certain forestry projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>Regulation 3(1) provides that forestry projects which are likely to have significant effects
                            on the environment (“EIA forestry projects”) require the consent of the Forestry
                            Commissioners (“EIA consent”) and must be carried out in accordance with that EIA consent.
                            Regulation 3(2) sets out the conditions under which such EIA consent may be granted, which
                            includes the performance of an environmental impact assessment (“EIA”) and the requirement
                            for the Forestry Commissioners to take into account environmental information (which is
                            defined in regulation 2(1)). Regulation 4 sets out mandatory conditions for every EIA
                            consent, to the effect that every EIA forestry project must be started within 5 years and
                            completed within 10 years of the relevant EIA consent being granted
                        </p>
                        <p>Regulation 5 sets out what the EIA process comprises and regulation 6 makes provision for
                            applications for EIA consent and sets out the content of a EIA report. Regulation 7 confers
                            on the Forestry Commissioners the functions of granting and refusing EIA consent and sets
                            out requirements relating to the period in which their determination may be made.
                        </p>
                        <p>Part 2 sets out procedures for determining whether a forestry project is an EIA forestry
                            project. Regulation 8 sets out which events will establish that a forestry project is an EIA
                            forestry project. Regulation 9 confers certain powers of exemption on the Forestry
                            Commissioners. Regulation 10 introduces schedule 1, which contains the thresholds for
                            forestry projects. By virtue of regulation 11(2) most forestry projects which do not exceed
                            the relevant threshold in schedule 1 will not be considered to be EIA forestry projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>Regulation 12 enables a request to be made to the Forestry Commissioners for a “screening
                            opinion”. Regulation 11 makes general provision in relation to such an opinion, including
                            that any screening opinion must be made by reference to the criteria in schedule 2.
                            Regulation 13 sets the time period for the adoption of such a screening opinion. If the time
                            period is exceeded, regulation 14 provides that the person who sought the screening opinion
                            may apply to the Scottish Ministers for a “screening direction”. The Scottish Ministers may
                            also make a screening direction at their own volition (regulation 11(5)(a))
                        </p>
                        <p>Part 3 sets out procedures for the preparation of EIA reports. Regulation 15 enables an
                            applicant for EIA consent to seek a “scoping opinion” from the Forestry Commissioners on the
                            information to be included in an EIA report. The types of information which may be required
                            are set out in schedule 3. The Forestry Commissioners must consult bodies with environmental
                            responsibilities before adopting a scoping opinion. Where the Forestry Commissioners fail to
                            adopt a scoping opinion with the time period specified in regulation 15(6) or (7), the
                            applicant may apply to the Scottish Ministers for a scoping direction (regulation 16(1)(b)).
                            The Scottish Ministers may also make a scoping direction of their own volition (regulation
                            16(1)(a)). Regulation 17 requires consultation bodies, if requested, to assist the
                            preparation of an EIA report by making information available to the applicant.

                            applicant may also submit information relating to the EIA report voluntarily. Such
                            information is together referred to as “additional information”. Regulation 21 provides that
                            notice of the receipt and availability of additional information provided by the applicant
                            after the initial gathering of information for an EIA report has taken place will require to

                            the decision notice following determination of EIA application. Regulation 25 requires
                            consideration to be given to the inclusion of monitoring measures. Regulation 26 requires

                            granted. Regulation 31 allows a person with sufficient interest or whose rights have been
                            impaired by the grant of EIA consent to make an application to the Court of Session.
                        </p>

                            a decision or (with intent to deceive) to withhold material information to that end.
                            Regulation 39 makes it an offence to breach an enforcement notice served under paragraph 3
                            of schedule 4. Regulation 40 provides for how these offences apply in the context of
                            offences committed by bodies corporate, Scottish partnerships or other unincorporated
                            associations. Regulation 41 revokes (with savings) the Environmental Impact Assessment
